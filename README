This is a simple demo application using Neo4J to create and display nodes for employee data.  An 
Employee node consists simply of a name and an employee ID.  Employee ID should be a positive number 
greater than zero. ID values are not expected to exceed one million.

How to run this demo application:

  1. Clone this repo

  2. Download and install the latest version of Neo4j from https://neo4j.com/download

  3. Launch Neo4j

  4. Select the default project or create a new one, then select 'New Database'.  Choose Local for type, 
     and then 'Start' the database.
  
  4. Using the Chrome browser, open the a URL to the index file in the local directory.  For 
     example:

          file:///Users/<username>/jandemo/index.html 

  5. From the index page, navigate to the create form to create employe nodes.

  6. Finally, from the list form, display the created employee nodes.


A few notes:

   Given the objectives and instructions, there is limited to no data checking. Correct data entry
   is the responsiblity of the user. 

   For convenience, a copy of the nodejs driver is included in this package.

   This JavaScript application code was tested in Google Chrome Version 63.0.3239.84 on 
   MacOS with Neo4j 3.1.1.
