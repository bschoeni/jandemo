This is a simple demo application using Neo4J to create and display nodes for employee data.  An 
Employee node consists simply of a name and an employee ID.  Employee ID should be a positive number 
greater than zero. ID values are not expected to exceed one million.

Prepare the demo:

  1. Clone this repo

  2. Download and install the latest version of Neo4j from https://neo4j.com/download

  3. Launch Neo4j

  4. Select the default project or create a new one, then select 'New Database'.  Choose Local for type, 
     and then 'Start' the database.
  
How to run the REST application:

  1. Check if you have Python 2.7.x available:

     	% python --version

  2. Check if you have the necessary Python packages available for 'web.py' and 'neo4jdriver'.  If the 
     packages are not present you may use pip (pip install web.py; pip install neo4jdriver) or
     another package installer

  3. Next, start the REST server script:

	% python neoREST.py 

  4. Using 'curl' or the tool of your choice, run the GET operation on the resource 'employees':

	% curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/employees

  5. Using 'curl', add a new employe record:

        % curl -d "name=<NAME>&id=<ID>" -X POST http://localhost:8080/employees


How to run the demo UI application:

  1. Using the Chrome browser, open the a URL to the index file in the local directory.  For 
     example:

          file:///Users/<username>/jandemo/index.html 

  2. From the index page, navigate to the create form to create employe nodes.

  3. Finally, from the list form, display the created employee nodes.


A few notes:

   Given the objectives and instructions, there is limited to no data checking. Correct data entry
   is the responsiblity of the user. 

   For convenience, a copy of the nodejs driver is included in this package.

   This JavaScript application code was tested in Google Chrome Version 63.0.3239.84 on 
   MacOS with Neo4j 3.1.1.
